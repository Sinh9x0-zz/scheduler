# scheduler

A real time scheduling application allowing employers to schedule employees more efficiently.

Employees are able to log in, accept shifts that they are qualified for, and request time off. Administrators are able to assign shifts if qualified employees are available, create new locations, employee accounts, and shifts, and edit employee information and availability. All request and assignments are done in real-time using socket.io.
